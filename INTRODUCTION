● Sockets are software structures that provide two way communication links between two
nodes. They are used primarily whenever real time communication is established
● The XO game, also known as Tic Tac Toe or Crosses and Noughts, is a paper-and-pencil
game for two players who take turns marking the spaces in a three-by-three grid with X or
O. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or
diagonal row is the winner.
● By applying the concepts of socket programming, and under the TCP/IP protocol, an
online tic tac toe game is created, and is playable by two players connected on a LAN
network.
● The coding is done in the python programming language, as it has various modules that
make it easier to carry out the tasks required to implement the program.
● The Socket module in python allows us to implement the socket programming concepts
easily.
● The threading module allows the use of multiprocessing.
● The PyGame module allows to make a physical representation of the game and provide a
board for the two players to play on.
● Additional modules are also used to improve quality of life and working of the program.
