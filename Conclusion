The Client-Server network model offers many benefits that stems from the fact that only a
single computer, or group of computers are the central repository for all the networking
services that you may need.
Security is relatively easy to implement with this type of network model, since you can set
up a single server computer to handle all information requests or login requests for the entire
network, thus you only need one username and password for each user on the network. So if
you ever need to change a password, you only need to change it at the server and the
password would be changed for the entire network.
